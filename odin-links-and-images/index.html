    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <a>click me</a>
    <p>Links require a destination address to be specified
        in their <strong>href</strong> attribute </p>
    <p>An <strong>attribute</strong> specifies additional
    information for the tag which enables or configures
    some kind of function of the tag</p>
    <p>An attribute consists of two parts:
        <ol>
            <li>name (written right after tag's name within the triangle brackets)</li>
            <li>value (written after attribute's name after "=" sign and within doublequotes</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Example tag: <strong>href="google.com"</strong></p>
    <p>A link with <strong>href</strong> attribute specified
    should work and redirect to another address.</p>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
    <p>A link is usually highlighted and colored in blue</p>
    <p>Links can point to any kind of resource on the internet,
        including videos, pictures, documents, but for the most
        part they are used to redirect to html documents aka webpages.
